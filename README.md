# RefreshCSS ü´ß

>Make your CSS so fresh, so clean.

`RefreshCSS` is a Python library that removes unused classes, ids, and element selectors from CSS.

## üîß Installation

`pip install refreshcss`

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

- Python library to integrate in other Python projects
- Can be used as a filter with `django-compressor` as part of minifying CSS

### üóúÔ∏è Integrate with django-compressor

Add `"refreshcss.filters.RefreshCSSFilter"` to `COMPRESS_FILTERS` in the Django settings file.

```python
COMPRESS_FILTERS = {
    "css": [
        "refreshcss.filters.RefreshCSSFilter",
        ...
    ],
    "js": [...],
}
```

## ü§ì How does it work?

1. Catalogue classes, ids, and elements that are currently being used in found HTML templates
1. Catalogue classes, ids, and elements in a CSS stylesheet
1. Return new CSS stylesheet that only contains rules that are actively being used by the HTML

## üßê Why?

I wanted to have a filter for `django-compressor` that would purge unused CSS as part of the `compress` step when deploying for [`coltrane`](https://coltrane.readthedocs.io) apps. After dealing with a manual process and attempting to integrate https://purgecss.com and https://github.com/uncss/uncss I thought "this couldn't be that hard to do in Python".

Which is always the thought at the beginning of every side project... and is never accurate.

## üôã FAQ

### Will this work with SPAs?

`RefreshCSS` only inspects HTML, so if CSS classes are being changed client-side then it will not know about it.

### Does this work by crawling a website URL?

Currently no, although that is a possibility in the future.

### Does this support HTML written in the Django Template Language?

Yes! That was a primary reason I built my own solution. üòÖ Jinja might also be possible to support with some small tweaks, although it is untested.

### Is this what people mean when they say "treeshaker"?

Maybe.ü§∑

### I found a bug!

Thanks for trying `RefreshCSS` out! Please make a PR (pull request) with a small test that replicates the bug or, if that is not possible, create a [new discussion](https://github.com/adamghill/refreshcss/discussions/new?category=ideas).
